# Meteor MadLib

##Project Description
  Purpose:
      This meteor app was an exercise to practice using jQuery in order to create a
    fun and simple Mad-Lib application.  At the same time, the exercise helped me get
    more familar with Meteor and practice Software Version Control (where one person 
    codes while the other researches information, then roles switch in between commits).
    
  Running the project:
    The Meteor Mad-Lib can be run on garrymeteormadlib.meteor.com.
